		<h1>Client Testimonials</h1>

		<div id="bkgd-text">
		<p>We believe to a degree that our photography speaks on its own, but we never pass up an opportunity for our clients to speak their truth about their photo sessions with our artists. Below are a few testimonials, written by real clients of Prism Photography what wanted to voice their opinions about being behind the lense, having a different make-up look, or seeing their hair in a totally different way. For client safety, only first names are used.</p>

	<p>I hate to admit it, but I have always struggled with body dyshmorphia. My friends paid for a session with Prism Photography and it has to be the greatest gift I have ever received. As soon as I stepped into the studio, I was put at ease. Adam listened to my concerns and dressed me in outfits that I felt comfortable in but also looked my best. I think I show every person I know my prism photos.</p>

	<p>Right off the bat, I just wanna say that I had a great time with the crew. I cannot take a good photo of me to save my life so I am glad Baby was there to help a brother out. They did a great job of showcasing my sneaker collection. I got respect for Prism Photography.</p>

	<p>Look, I booked a session with Prism Photography for the sole purpose of cool, unique pictures to add to my instagram. I was looking to re-invent my feed. Baby and crew listened to my ideas and then mixed in their own concepts. I would recommend this company to any up and coming influencer.</p>
