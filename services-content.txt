1. Indoor Studio
	Studio C is available to rent Tuesday to Friday, for 2 hour spans of time. You cannot book more than two 
	hours in one day. Studio C comes with a state-of-the-art lighting system to insure the best quality photos.
2. Natural Light Studio
	Not only do we use artifical light at Prism Photography, we also have a natural light studio that uses 
	natural light from an array of windows. The availability of this studio varies with the weather, so the hours
	available for rental change depending on that week's forecast. However, the most popular hours booked are 
	sunrise and sunset. 
3. Mobile Lighting Equipement
	Not all beginner photograpers have proper lighting or know how to properly use it. We have an easy guide to 
	follow to know and use our mobile lighting equipment. We want all striving photographers to have the
	opportunity to work with professional lighting.
4. Classes
	Once a month, our Prism staff hosts a class on a specific subject in photography. If you attend, you will
	learn valuable skills that can be used in your photography journey. To attend a session, it will cost $50.
	Subjects of the class will be released prior to the class so clients can decided if they would like to attend.
