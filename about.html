			<h1>About Us</h1>

			<p class="white-text">Prism Photography simply started when founder, Francis “Baby” Gunk, was getting inspired on a daily basis scrolling through her social media feed. She saw all these amazing concepts of art, makeup, and beauty and wanted to blend them all together. She sought out to learn everything she could about photography in order to best showcase the art she was seeing.

			 After attending Pennsylvania Art Institute, she gathered a group of hard-working creatives in New York City. They set up an office and studio space in the early 2010’s and started to grow their brand. Prism Photography is sought after for their new-age ideas by social media influencers to magazine editors. Prism Photography offers a wide range of talents with creativity and beauty at the heart.</p>
